# Overview

Squarespace is an all-in-one content management system, or CMS.  We have 
picked SquareSpace as the hosting and website service provider for the Unity 
In Learning website.   SquareSpace allows us to utilize a variety of web site 
development tools, as well as the ability to integrate our own plug-in 
services.  

However, SquareSpace does not allow us to have our own database similar to 
Wordpress or Drupal.  This means that most pages presented with SquareSpace 
are static in nature.  Where needed, we have integrated dynamic content 
from Google Spreadsheets via JavaScript and jQuery functions.  The functions 
developed can be found under ["Components"](/Docs/components).
