### Action Item Requests

<br>
***Intro message***

The Museum is proud to give back to the community that supports our education mission by 
donating passes to schools and parent teacher organizations.  Please note that we 
receive hundreds of requests for donated items and are only able to give one set of 
4 passes to a school per 12-month period.  We are not accepting applications from 
other groups such as scouts, 4H clubs, fraternal organizations, little league and 
sports events, medical research and patient support groups, etc. 

In order to request a donated item, please fill out and submit the form below. 
Once your request is received, it will be reviewed and you will be contacted within 
two weeks as to our decision. If we are able to donate to your event, we will email 
you a special PDF file that includes four admission passes to the Museum. Please 
print out the PDF for your fundraiser event. Only printed tickets can be redeemed 
at the admissions desk.
