### Lazy Summary

Lazy Summary is a paid plugin which extends the 30 post limit that SquareSpace imposes.  Once a summary block is defined, regardless of the type (carousel, grid, etc), SquareSpace will normally limit the number of entries displayed to 30.  This plugin adds some JavaScript tricks behind the scenes to get around that limit.
