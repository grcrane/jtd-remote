### Scholarship Fund Opportunities

<br>
***Intro message***

The Discover Science Assistance Fund offers need-based scholarships.  It may cover only a portion of admission fees, but can be used for Field Trips, Outreach, or Distance Learning programs. These funds are made possible by the generosity of many friends of the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum.
